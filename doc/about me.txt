I completed my education at Islamic University of Indonesia in Yogyakarta with a degree in Computer Science or Information Technology. I started my career as an IT Consultant for software implementation and development. I have a hobby of sports, including running/jogging, playing futsal, and soccer. Besides sports, I also love traveling and have visited places like Bali, Manado, Yogyakarta, and other tourist destinations in Indonesia. I also enjoy exploring the natural attractions in my hometown of Temanggung, Jawa Tengah, which is known for its location between Mount Sumbing and Sindoro.
